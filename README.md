# Data-Analysis-on-A-B-testing-results

The objective of this project is to analyze the A/B testing result from an ecommerce website new UI experiment 
(Diaclaimer: this is a school project based on  simulated data set)

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) for preliminary data quality check 

- Proposed hypotheses regarding the causes of conversion rate drop in the test group

- Examined experiment bias using decision tree algorithm to automate the experiment data quality check, identified the states having issue with randomization 

- Re-did Welchâ€™s T test on remainder dataset and results showed no stats sig difference between groups

- Proposed business recommendation regarding the implementation of the new UI
